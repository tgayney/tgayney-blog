>**Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP)** is a protocol that separates the identity of a device from its location on the network. It allows sites to create tunnels between them and identifies devices using **Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs)**. Traffic then enters and exits the network through **Routing Locators (RLOCs)**. LISP provides benefits such as **simplified traffic engineering**, **multihoming**, and **mobility support**.
