Hello, my name is Timothy Gayney I'm an IT professional with over three years of customer service and IT/NOC Service Desk experience, passionate about technology and helping people solve complex problems. My background in \*\*Computer Networking\*\* and \*\*Cyber Security\*\* has given me a strong technical foundation, complemented by hands-on certifications including \*\*CCNA\*\*, \*\*RHCSA\*\*, and \*\*CompTIA A+\*\*.



I’m currently expanding my expertise by studying for the \*\*CCNP ENCOR v1.2\*\*, as I work toward advancing my career in networking. I thrive in environments that challenge me to learn, grow, and deliver reliable technical solutions.



This blog serves as both a \*\*portfolio\*\* and a \*\*learning journal\*\*, where I can share my experiences completing \*\*network solutions\*\*, \*\*packet capture labs\*\*, and \*\*case studies\*\*. My goal is to showcase my technical growth while also contributing to the broader IT community by sharing insights, challenges, and solutions that others might find valuable. For me, IT isn’t just a job — it’s about continuous learning, problem-solving, and innovation.



I’m always open to connecting with like-minded professionals and exploring new opportunities in the IT and networking space. Feel free to reach out—I’d love to chat!
