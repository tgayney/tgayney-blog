Hello, my name is Timothy Gayney. I'm an IT professional with over three years of customer service and IT/NOC Service Desk experience, passionate about technology and helping people solve complex problems. My background in **Computer Networking** and **Cyber Security** has given me a strong technical foundation, complemented by hands-on certifications including **CCNA**, **RHCSA**, and **CompTIA A+**.

I’m currently expanding my expertise by studying for the **CCNP ENCOR v1.2**, as I work toward advancing my career in networking. I thrive in environments that challenge me to learn, grow, and deliver reliable technical solutions.

I have a particular interest in **virtualization**, **VPN technologies**, and **network automation**—areas I believe are critical to building efficient, scalable, and secure modern infrastructures. I enjoy exploring how these technologies intersect to improve connectivity, streamline operations, and enhance security across enterprise environments.

This blog serves as both a **portfolio** and a **learning journal**, where I share my experiences completing **network solutions**, **packet capture labs**, and **case studies**. My goal is to showcase my technical growth while contributing to the broader IT community by sharing insights, challenges, and solutions that others might find valuable. For me, IT isn’t just a job — it’s about continuous learning, problem-solving, and innovation.

I’m always open to connecting with like-minded professionals and exploring new opportunities in the IT and networking space. Feel free to reach out — I’d love to chat!
